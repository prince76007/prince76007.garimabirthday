     * For example:
     * "Beloved sweetheart": "./imgs/xiaokeai.jpg"

     * If you don't want an image, simply start each line with two forward slashes. For example, the image for "Today is your birthday" won't be displayed :)
     * Tip: It's better to use square or nearly square images for a better display.
